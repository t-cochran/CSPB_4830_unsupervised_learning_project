## Predicting BBC news topics with unsupervised learning algorithms
*CSPB 4830 Machine Learning - Summer 2022*

* Author: Thomas Cochran

__Project Description__

* The goal of this project is to analyze the body of text in BBC news articles and predict their topic, e.g. business, sports, or tech.

* This is a dataset we have worked with when covering non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), but I will be using it to train and evaluate other different unsupervised algorithms, namely: K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and latent dirichlet allocation (LDA).

__Problem Type__

* This is an unsupervised classification problem. We will be predicting an article topic using patterns and features in the article text. 

__Project Motivation__

* In addition to learning more about unsupervised algorithms, these methods can be useful for improving article organization and distribution online, either by suggesting topic tags to news articles or automatically applying them. More generally, topic modeling is useful for categorizing large bodies of unlabeled text data, which can organize the data to facilitate further analysis.
